\description{
The SilvermanAGutData dataset contains 16S rRNA gene based high-throughput
profiling of 4 in vitro artificial gut models. The sampling was done hourly
and daily to capture sub-daily dynamics of microbial community originating
from human feces. The data consists of 413 taxa from 639 samples.
The data set can be used to investigate longitudinal dynamics of microbial
community in a controlled environment.

Column metadata includes the days of sampling, vessel identifier, sampling
frequency pre-post challenge with Bacteroides ovatus.

The row metadata of the microbiome data contains taxonomic information on
the Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family and Genus and Species level.

The row tree consists of a phylogenetic tree build using sequence
information of 413 taxa.

As reference sequences the ASV are provided.

All data are downloaded from ExperimentHub and cached for local re-use
