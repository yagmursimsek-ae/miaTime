\description{
This time-series data set contains absolute temporal abundances
for 16 human gut species that were assembled in an in vitro gut system. These
were subjected to a variety of disturbances over a period of 20 days. The
sample data includes measurements for Acetate, Butyrate, Propionate, and
optical density.
}
\details{
The data is available also on
\url{https://github.com/microsud/syncomR}
The data contains 183 samples from 3 in vitro gut system, 61 per bioreactor
collected three times daily.
The current implementation in \pkg{miaTime} provides this as
\code{\link[TreeSummarizedExperiment:TreeSummarizedExperiment-class]{TreeSummarizedExperiment}}
object.
